# The Kit - On the Road with the fans
##

The Kit is a DJ duo of two girls. The band is touring heavily 
and they want a site that si like a meeting place for fans. 
Their fanbase is growing rapidly as they tour the world and their 
spectacular shows are becoming infamous among fans.
A page where listeners can discover them, a fan page where fans
can follow them, stay updated, buy merch or support them
on channels like Mix-cloud (a sort of youtube for DJs where 
artists earn money from subscribers).

Fans will come back to the site to stay updated on whatÂ´s 
happening - so the news section is where they will find 
recent tour photos - some taken by fans, comments from fans, 
upcoming releases and exclusive content not found anywhere else. 
The client want the site to look good with high quality photos
preferably live photos from shows they had.

## Features


**Zoom feature**


Prior to starting build of the site I did some research on similar
artists webpages and found a style I liked where the background on
all pages consist of high-res photos that will start to zoom in
once the visitor opens the page.
[Reference website: Carl Cox](https://carlcox.com/)
Using media query the same effect could be possible on smaller devices.
I also liked the style of menu from Carl Cox site on mobile devices 
so that was something I wanted to incorporate in the build.
Unfortunatly build a hamburger navbar was to complicated at my level.

Using zoom is an effective yet tasteful way to present photos for the user. 
As these photos are from live shows the goal is to get the users more
interested in visiting a show.

The page consist of 4 pages, they are accesscible through the navigation
bar at the top of each page.

The pages are:
* Main page
* News 
* Merch
* Support
* Gallery


**The Navbar**
This is a fully responsive navigation that appears on every page. On the intro page the logo appears bigger and stationed on the left side for a more effectful display of the background image. On the main page there is a text area up to the left displaying where the next show will be. The logo act as a return to homepage in the navbar.

**Spotify player**
On the top main page is a spotify player that the user can press play and hear the bands most popular track.
The user can also from this player follow the band on spotify. I did some research about tweaking the spotify
widget. The widget can be tweaked in many ways using spotify developer tools to fit different purposes.

**Merch**
In the merch section the user can look at merch items designed by the band. In the form at the bottom they can 
write a request for certain items.

**Gallery**
In the gallery below are photos that the user can hover over to enlarge them or press a photo to open it 
in a new tab. This section can be filled with more photos later on.

**News section**
In the news section below are two columns. The first column is a fan oriented column displaying photos and comments mostly
from fans. The right column is where the band can post news and share what is going on like upcoming releases or
a new design of a merch item.

**Support section**
This where links to the bands platforms are gathered. By clicking them the user opens a new tab to the bands user profile on the choosen platform.

## Design

I started out this project using a template from ![htmlrev.com](htmlrev.com) which
I modified pretty heavily.

## Flying Beer Design
For this effect I used this source code
![Make-an-Image-fly-across-the-Screen]https://support.cargo.site/Make-an-Image-Fly-Across-the-Screen

---

## Accessibility ##

I have used alt text on images and the fonts I picked on google fonts was
choosen with the purpose of making reading more easy. Perhaps larger fonts
could be used on the main page in the column and the news section where it is
quite small.
