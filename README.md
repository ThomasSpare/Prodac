## Features

**Beer of the month**

Displays special deals each month with a call to action buttton


**Gallery**

The images can directly be browsed from the top of the page below the navbar, displaying images
of the brewery and the people working there. If a user opens any of the lightboxes on the site
the user can choose to swipe though every image on the site in the window.

## Design

I started out this project using a template from htmlrev.com which
I modified pretty heavily.

## Flying Beer Design
For this effect I used this source code
![Make-an-Image-fly-across-the-Screen](https://support.cargo.site/Make-an-Image-Fly-Across-the-Screen)

I tweaked this image using Javascript to switch between different beer flavours when flying over the screen.
The flying beer can will not be diplayed for smaller devices since it is distracting the viewer to much.

## Accessibility ##

I have used alt text on images and the fonts I picked on google fonts was
choosen with the purpose of making reading more easy. Most of the the images are also
enlarged when a user hovers over them.
